Today's lecture was difficult for me to follow due to the breakneck speed. I enjoyed working on the deque today, it was a breeze and I'm really seeing the value of class composition. Once I got to working on the pyramid assignment I was pretty lost and I'm still trying to work through it. I have no doubt that pyramid is awesome, and while I can follow along with the class notes, I'm not really at a point yet where I understand what's going on. I'm hoping that will change soon.
